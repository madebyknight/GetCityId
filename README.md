# GetCityId
Get city ID by city name [OpenWeatherMap API]
OpenWeatherMap.org suggests that you use city IDs as opposed to City Name or address so I made a script that does just that.
You can get an API key from their website => OpenWeatherMap.org. There you will also be able to download a json file full of city names and IDs.
